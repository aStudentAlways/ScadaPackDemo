# ScadaPackDemo

-------------------------------------------
This code shows how to write a program in C to run on a [SCADAPack RTU](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/product-range-presentation/61247-scadapack-100%2C-300%2C-32/). Most people who use SCADAPack are not professional programmers, so a simple demo is useful to show how to get started. 

I've written quite a bit of C for SCADAPack lately, and I plan on adding to this demo to show some of the things that I have learned. Let me know if you want me to add anything specific. 

I plan on keeping most of the documentation on [my blog](https://parajkayande.com/), instead of in this document, to minimize the documentation effort. 

Note that SCADAPack CTools are licensed, and the archive does not include the <CTOOLS.H> header file from Schneider Electric. To compile this code yourself you will need to obtain a CTools license.
